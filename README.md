ðŸš€ Building an Interactive Dashboard for Flipkart Sales Analysis ðŸ“Š

I recently had the opportunity to work on an engaging case study involving Flipkartâ€™s sales dataset. This dataset includes various columns, such as ID, title, rating, main category, device, price, and star ratings (from 1 to 5). My goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insightful analytics on customer ratings and product categories.

To enhance data visualization, I formulated several key questions for the dashboard:

Ratings and Main Category: Analyzing how different product categories are rated can reveal trends in consumer preferences.

Title and Device: Displaying the product title alongside the device can help in understanding which devices are most popular in specific categories.

Total 5-Star Ratings: Highlighting the titles that received the highest ratings allows us to identify top-performing products.

Ratings and 2-Star Reviews: Investigating the ratings, particularly 2-star reviews, provides insights into areas needing improvement.

Total Star Ratings: Summarizing the total ratings across all stars gives a comprehensive view of product performance.

This interactive dashboard not only visualizes the data effectively but also facilitates informed decision-making. By showcasing trends and insights, stakeholders can better understand customer satisfaction and preferences, leading to enhanced strategies for product offerings and marketing initiatives.

Creating this dashboard was a rewarding experience, emphasizing the importance of data-driven insights in todayâ€™s competitive e-commerce landscape.
